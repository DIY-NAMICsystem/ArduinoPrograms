# Paradigm 5: Introduction of Omission Trials


### Simple Description

- Middle Light Blinks to indicate trial initiation is possible
- Once mouse initiates trial, one response port (left / right) is pseudorandomly selected and light is turned on.
- Light stays on for a limited duration of stimulus duration (SD)
- Invalid Trial (Poke to incorrect port): No Reward
- Omission Trial (No response until stimulus duration): No Reward
- Inter-trial Interval (ITI): variable ITI of average 45s


### Key Metrics

- Total Pokes
- Incorrect Pokes before Trial Initiation
- Number of Initiated Trials
- Number of Correct Trials (Rewards Retrieved)
- Number of Pokes during Reward Window
- Number of Incorrect Trials
- Number of Omission Trials
- Number of Pokes during ITI window
