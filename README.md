# DIY-NAMIC Behavioral Programs


This is the second repository, in a three-part series, which contains code for behavioral programs which can be used with DIY-NAMIC boxes. This first repository includes build instructions for DIY-NAMIC [hardware build instructions](https://github.com/DIY-NAMICsystem/Hardware-Documentation). The third repository has code to analyze the data generated from the DIY-NAMIC boxes [data analysis repository](https://github.com/DIY-NAMICsystem/Data-Analysis).

### Arduino Behavioral Programs

This repository hosts code for some behavioral paradigms that we have run on DIY-NAMIC boxes which are controlled by an Arduino UNO. The paradigms are written in Arduino, which is based on C++. (Note however that the Arduino IDE environment is [different](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=513643.0), so don't expect all the standard C/C++ features and libraries to work in the IDE.)

####  Currently Available Programs

Each page will have a logic flow diagram of the programs to aid the reader.
