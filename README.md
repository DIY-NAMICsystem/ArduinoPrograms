# DNAMIC Part 2 - Behavioral Paradigms


This is the second repository in a three-part series containing the behavioral paradigms of DNAMIC. If you are new to Dartmouth Nautiyal Arduino Modular Instrumental Conditioning (DNAMIC), please consider visiting this first repository introducing DNAMIC and explaining the [hardware build instructions](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Hardware-Documentations). If you're interested in the data analysis portion of DNAMIC, visit the [data analysis repository](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Data-Analysis).

### Arduino Behavioral Programs

This repository hosts the different programs you can run on DNAMIC. Arduino is the control center of DNAMIC, so essentially the programs are being run by Arduino microprocessors. The paradigms are written entirely in Arduino, which is based on C++. (Note however that the Arduino IDE environment is [different](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=513643.0), so don't expect all the standard C/C++ features and libraries to work in the IDE.)

####  Currently Available Programs

Each page will have a logic flow diagram of the programs to aid the reader.
