# AIM - Behavioral Paradigms

##### Note: AIM is informally referred to as DNAMIC (Dartmouth Nautiyal Arduino Modular Instrumental Chamber) in the lab. Therefore I might use the two terms (AIM / DNAMIC) interchangeably to refer to the same thing.

This is the second repository in a three-part series containing the behavioral paradigms of AIM. If you are new to Arduino Instrumental Modules (AIM), please consider visiting this [first repository](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Hardware-Documentations) introducing AIM and explaining the **hardware build instructions.** If you're interested in the data analysis portion of AIM, visit the [third repository](https://github.com/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Data-Analysis).

### Arduino Behavioral Paradigms

This repository hosts the different paradigms you can run on AIM. Arduino is the control center of AIM, so essentially the paradigms are being run by Arduino microprocessors. The paradigms are written entirely in Arduino, which is based on C++. (Note however that the Arduino IDE environment is [different](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=513643.0), so don't expect all the standard C/C++ features and libraries to work in the IDE.)

####  Currently Available paradigms

Each page will have a logic flow diagram of the paradigm to aid the reader.

* [**1. Port Habituation**](aa)
* [**2. Continuous Cue Training:**](aa)
* [**3. Random Forced Choice**](aa)
* [**4. Trial Initiated Reward - Part 1**](aa)
* [**5. Trial Initiated Reward - Part 2 (omission)**](aa)
* [**6. Trial Initiated Reward - Part 3 (delay window)**](aa)

NOT CURRENTLY USED

* [**7. Trial Initiated Reward - Variant 2 (Mid On)**](aa)
* [**8. Trial Initiated Reward - Variant 3 (Mid Blink)**](aa)
